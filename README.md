### A Simple Calculator

Purpose of this exercise is to learn TDD in Javascript using Jasmine. 

Design a simple calculator to carry out the basic arithmetic operations. Your calculator should have four text fields:
* two for operands
* one for the operator
* one to display the result (non-editable)

The result should be displayed when both the operands and operator has valid values.

Use Jasmine for your tests. The code should completely avoid branching constructs.
